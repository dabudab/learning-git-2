                <h1>Was it I?</h1>
                <h2>Takida</h2>
                <p>
                    I was barely breathin<br>
                    I was fightin you in my room<br>
                    My heart just keeps on bleedin<br>
                    You feel so bare, you know it's way too soon
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I've tried,<br>
                    And it's time to confess,<br>
                    Was it I? Was it I,<br>
                    Who broke you down last night?<br>
                    Do you mind?<br>
                    I can't find<br>
                    Not a single ground<br>
                    Will you give me one last try?<br>
                    To be alive
                </p>
                <p>
                    Days flow into horror<br>
                    Say your prayers for what it's worth<br>
                    Take your last look forward<br>
                    Holy visions, watch them burn<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    But I've tried,<br>
                    And it's time to confess,<br>
                    Was it I? Was it I,<br>
                    Who broke you down last night?<br>
                    Do you mind?<br>
                    I can't find not a single ground<br>
                    Will you give me one last try?
                </p>
                <p>
                    There's so much we can build on<br>
                    So much to lose<br>
                    It seems that everyone's tired<br>
                    This is nothing I choose<br>
                    Maybe tomorrow is different<br>
                    I don't know how<br>
                    Cause the only word in my mind isâ€¦
